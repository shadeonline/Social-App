I have completed a social media app called Social. Social is a social media much like that of Instagram. The purpose of the Social is to create a platform where users can share interesting artwork or images they made with other like minded people online.
Several features of Social include:
- Posting images with descriptions for followers to view
- Follow and unfollow users on the platform
- Live chatting with users who are followed with stored chat history
- Personal page to display one’s images and customisable biography section Creation of accounts
- Discovery section to ‘discover’ other users
- API interface where users can use to retrieve/post specific information
